CHANGELOG
=========

NOTE: More tools exist, but are only handed out to specific people
who develop ipv6 security/pentest tools themselves, or support the
thc-ipv6 toolkit development. If this matches *you* send me an
email to vh (at) thc (dot) org , with "thc-ipv6 antispam" in the
subject line.

v1.2 - June 2010
 * compile fixes
 * test case added to implementation6

v1.1 - June 2010
 * dnsdict6: big wordlist update
 * upgraded thc-ipv6 license to GPLv3

v1.0 - May 2010 - PRIVATE
 * beta release

v0.9 - April/May 2010 - PRIVATE
 * added dnsdict6
 * added trace6
 * added flood_router6
 * added flood_advertise6
 * added fuzz_ip6
 * added implementation6d
 * implementation6:
	- renamed from test_implementation6
	- added A LOT of test cases and reply checks
 * fake_router6:
	- changed command line options
	- added default route entry (not supported by many systems though)
	- added DNS server ip (the official dns multicast address)
	- small fixes
 * alive6:
	- small fixes
	- added -l switch for using the link layer address
 * library:
	- fixed a big bug in the routing module, library thought sometimes a
	   remote network is local!
	- fixed a bug where a hard/permanent set mac for a destination would
	   not be found when the dst is not alive
	- now chooses an alternate IP6 address when the prefered one
	   is not available (link vs. global)
	- fixed TTL setting when using raw mode
	- supporting mobile home address option in dst option (for checksum)
	- pcap was opened in promisc mode - shouldnt have been, unnecessary
	- valid icmp checksum for mobile home address and routing pointer == 0
 	- TCP can be now added as a header too + checksum calculation, but
	   not for inverse_packet (yet - no application for that currently).
