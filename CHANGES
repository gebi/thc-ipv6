CHANGELOG
=========

NOTE: More tools exist, but are only handed out to specific people
who develop ipv6 security/pentest tools themselves, or support the
thc-ipv6 toolkit development. If this matches *you* send me an
email to vh (at) thc (dot) org , with "thc-ipv6 antispam" in the
subject line.




v1.4 - December 2010 - PUBLIC

    - command line format changed
    - added target mac option, needed for new vulnerablity found
 * dnsdict6:
    - added 87 more entries to the dictionary
    - now identified even multiple wildcard IPs and displays them accordingly
    - now prints the number of unique IPv6 addresses founds
 * fuzz_ip6:
    - added fuzzing query, report and done MLD + query and report MLDv2 types
    - fuzzing first and last two bytes of IPv6 addresses in the packets
    - command line option for specifying an IPv6 address within the packets
    - added many options
 * trace6:
    - added unreachable detection 
    - added more informative output
    - now multiple run save
    - fixed a core dump which happened on rare occasions
 * changed command line options for fake_router6 to allow specification of DNS
 * toobig6: tighter mtu and removed debug output still present in the code, oops
 * implementation6: added three more test cases, enhanced four test cases, bugfix
 * compile warning fixes (dnsdict6, sendpees6, thc-ipv6-lib)
 * Makefile beautification and header fixes by xmw<at>gentoo<dot>org

 * library:
    - BUG: raw mode does not work! Needs to be implemented properly by someone :-)
    - imporant fix for gathering a local mac, required for Mac OS/X targets
    - added thc_pcap_init_promisc function (required for new fake_mld6 functionality)
    - added thc_is_dst_local function (required for new alive6 functionality)
    - added thc_add_udp function (required for new alive6 functionality)
    - added thc_bind_udp_port function (required for fake_dhcps6)
    - added thc_bind_multicast_to_socket (required for fake_dhcps6)
    - added thc_ipv6_show_errors function to toggle error messages from library
    - optimization in thc_send_as_fragment6 to only get MACs once :-)
    - fix for max offset in thc_add_hdr_fragment, plus bad value check
    - fix for beautification ipv6 address output function
    - looked for memory leaks and removed all I found
    - for performance reasons also stale neighbor mac entries are used now
    - made library thread safe

v1.3 - PRIVATE

v1.2 - June 2010
 * compile fixes
 * test case added to implementation6

v1.1 - June 2010
 * dnsdict6: big wordlist update
 * upgraded thc-ipv6 license to GPLv3

v1.0 - May 2010 - PRIVATE
 * beta release

v0.9 - April/May 2010 - PRIVATE
 * added dnsdict6
 * added trace6
 * added flood_router6
 * added flood_advertise6
 * added fuzz_ip6
 * added implementation6d
 * implementation6:
	- renamed from test_implementation6
	- added A LOT of test cases and reply checks
 * fake_router6:
	- changed command line options
	- added default route entry (not supported by many systems though)
	- added DNS server ip (the official dns multicast address)
	- small fixes
 * alive6:
	- small fixes
	- added -l switch for using the link layer address
 * library:
	- fixed a big bug in the routing module, library thought sometimes a
	   remote network is local!
	- fixed a bug where a hard/permanent set mac for a destination would
	   not be found when the dst is not alive
	- now chooses an alternate IP6 address when the prefered one
	   is not available (link vs. global)
	- fixed TTL setting when using raw mode
	- supporting mobile home address option in dst option (for checksum)
	- pcap was opened in promisc mode - shouldnt have been, unnecessary
	- valid icmp checksum for mobile home address and routing pointer == 0
 	- TCP can be now added as a header too + checksum calculation, but
	   not for inverse_packet (yet - no application for that currently).


v0.8 - June 2007 - PRIVATE

 * Improved Makefile

   (its a new DOS attack)


v0.6 - MARCH 2006 - BETA
 * Added fake_mipv6 tool to spoof mobile ipv6 binding updates
 * Fixed a bug in the thc_toobig6 and some other thc_ icmp6 lib functions


v0.5 - FEBRUARY 2006 - ALPHA

v0.4 - FEBRUARY 2006 - ALPHA
 * Added fake_mld6 tool


v0.3 - JANUARY 2006 - ALPHA

v0.2 - NOVEMBER 2005 - ALPHA
