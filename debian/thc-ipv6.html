 [0x00] News and Changelog

	CHANGELOG for 0.7:
	###########
	* Added sendpees6.c and a patch from willdamn(ad)gmail.com - thanks a lot!
	  This is the 2nd public version, released during HITB 2006

	Have fun!


 [0x01] Introduction
 	Welcome to the mini website of the THC IPV6 project.

	This code was inspired when I got into touch with IPv6, learned more and
	more about it - and then found no tools to play (read: "hack") around with.
	First I tried to implement things with libnet, but then found out that
	the ipv6 implementation is only partial - and sucks. I tried to add the
	missing code, but well, it was not so easy, hence I saved my time and
	quickly wrote my own library.

	4. The GPL 3.0 applies to this code.


 [0x03] The Included Tools
	- parasite6: icmp neighbor solitication/advertisement spoofer, puts you
	   as man-in-the-middle, same as ARP mitm (and parasite)
	- alive6: an effective alive scanng, which will detect all systems
	   listening to this address
	- fake_router6: announce yourself as a router on the network, with the
	   highest priority
	- redir6: redirect traffic to you intelligently (man-in-the-middle) with
	   a clever icmp6 redirect spoofer
	- toobig6: mtu decreaser with the same intelligence as redir6
	- detect-new-ip6: detect new ip6 devices which join the network, you can
	   run a script to automatically scan these systems etc.
	- dos-new-ip6: detect new ip6 devices and tell them that their chosen IP
	   collides on the network (DOS).
	- fake_mld6: announce yourself in a multicast group of your choice on the net
	- fake_mipv6: steal a mobile IP to yours if IPSEC is not needed for authentication
	- fake_advertiser6: announce yourself on the network
	- smurf6: local smurfer
	- rsmurf6: remote smurfer, known to work only against linux at the moment
	- sendpees6: a tool by willdamn(ad)gmail.com, which generates a neighbor
          solicitation requests with a lot of CGAs (crypto stuff ;-) to keep the CPU busy. nice.


 [0x04] Documentation 
 
	THC-IPV6 comes with a rather long <a href="README">README file</a> that describes the
	details about the usage and library interface.


 [0x05] Development &amp; Contributions

	Your contributions are more than welcomed!
	
	If you find bugs, coded enhancements or wrote a new attack tool
	please send them to vh (at) thc (dot) org
